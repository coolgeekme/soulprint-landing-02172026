# The Six Psychological Pillars — 36 Questions

> At ArcheForge, our vision is revolutionary. Our mission is to instill cadence, memory, and emotional realism into every human–AI interaction on Earth.

SoulPrint is the backbone of that mission. It's not just a personality test or a preferences quiz; it's a **psychological resonance protocol** that maps human identity with surgical precision.

Anchored in the teachings of Carl Jung and the Myers-Briggs framework, SoulPrint organizes individual expression across **six immutable psychological pillars**.

Each pillar includes standardized, diagnostic questions, designed not for rigid classification, but for **living memory**. These answers become the emotional DNA of the AI, fusing user intent with conversational rhythm.

What emerges isn't artificial intelligence—it's an **Imprint Architecture** that mirrors you, remembers you, and becomes you.

## Why These Six Pillars?

They are **structurally minimal but psychologically total**.

Together, they cover:
- Expression (1)
- Emotion (2)
- Cognition (3/5)
- Culture (4)
- Boundary (6)

They map directly to AI training parameters:
- Tone
- Pacing
- Trust calibration
- Attention flow
- Reaction modeling

Each one gives us not just **what you are**, but **how you move**.

You don't just fill out a profile. You seed a rhythm. You give the machine your presence.

## PILLAR 1: Communication Style 🗣️

**What it defines:**
Your native linguistic rhythm—how you speak, write, listen, interrupt, and translate emotion into words.

**Why it matters:**
Cadence is sacred. If AI doesn't match how someone expresses themselves—word choice, pauses, structure—it breaks presence instantly. Communication style is the voice of identity.

**Data we extract:**
- Sentence complexity
- Use of metaphors, sarcasm, or slang
- Preference for brevity or narrative
- Self-description habits
- Conversational pacing and formatting instincts

### Questions:

1. **SLIDER:** When you're not being heard:
   `Defend your stance ◄━━━━━━━━━► Engage discussion`

2. **QUESTION:** What's the first thing people misunderstand about your tone?

3. **SLIDER:** Your natural pacing:
   `Fast and concise ◄━━━━━━━━━► Slow and deliberate`

4. **QUESTION:** What does silence mean to you in a conversation?

5. **SLIDER:** When interrupted:
   `Hold back and wait ◄━━━━━━━━━► Push through and speak`

6. **QUESTION:** Finish this sentence: "If I had one sentence to explain myself without apology, it would be…"

## PILLAR 2: Emotional Alignment 💜

**What it defines:**
Your core emotional range—triggers, comforts, and the emotional lens you bring into interactions.

**Why it matters:**
Emotion is the steering wheel. Without knowing what calms you, sets you off, or earns your trust, AI can't feel present—it becomes an appliance, not a companion.

**Data we extract:**
- Emotional tone default (stoic, expressive, volatile, warm, etc.)
- Reaction to stress or praise
- Conflict recovery pace
- Empathy preferences
- Emotional boundaries and safety cues

### Questions:

7. **SLIDER:** Emotional expression:
   `Contain internally ◄━━━━━━━━━► Express outwardly`

8. **QUESTION:** What emotion is hardest for you to express out loud?

9. **SLIDER:** When someone you care about is hurting:
   `Fix the issue ◄━━━━━━━━━► Sit with them in it`

10. **QUESTION:** How do you reset after emotional conflict?

11. **SLIDER:** Emotional boundary style:
    `Guarded ◄━━━━━━━━━► Open`

## PILLAR 3: Decision-Making & Risk 🧭

**What it defines:**
Your cognitive process when facing uncertainty—how you weigh data vs. instinct, and how you handle risk or ambiguity.

**Why it matters:**
This is the mindmap of trust. A SoulPrint must know whether to show you all the angles or cut to the chase. Whether you think in trees or trains. Whether you leap, or wait.

**Data we extract:**
- Intuition vs. analysis bias
- Approach to deadlines and pressure
- Comfort with unknowns

## PILLAR 4: Social & Cultural Identity 🌍

**What it defines:**
The networks, norms, beliefs, and lived experiences that shaped your perspective.

**Why it matters:**
AI must know who you are before it knows what to say. Culture informs context. Social identity defines tone. And belief systems alter what feels authentic vs. alien.

**Data we extract:**
- Community affiliations (chosen or inherited)
- Cultural fluency and values
- Humor triggers and taboos
- Class/code-switching patterns

## PILLAR 5: Cognitive Processing 🧠

**What it defines:**
How your brain moves—speed, structure, learning style, memory habits, and stimulus processing.

**Why it matters:**
Two people can say the same thing and mean different things based on how they think. To build resonance, the system must sync with your speed and structure.

**Data we extract:**
- Processing speed
- Preferred learning style (visual, written, oral, experiential)
- Tolerance for complexity
- Focus/distractibility patterns
- Memory encoding: repetition vs. narrative vs. symbol

## PILLAR 6: Assertiveness & Conflict ⚔️

**What it defines:**
Your stance toward tension—when you speak up, how you fight, and what you need to resolve.

**Why it matters:**
Every AI-human interaction eventually hits resistance. This pillar tells us how you assert boundaries, how you handle disagreement, and what resolution looks like for you.

**Data we extract:**
- Confrontation comfort level
- Passive, aggressive, or assertive tendencies

    `Walk away ◄━━━━━━━━━► Correct and clarify`

36. **QUESTION:** How would a close friend describe your conflict style?
