Last set of questions, Ace. This is about capturing anything we missed and getting your final wisdom.

**FINAL QUESTIONS:**

1. Looking back at all these questions, is there anything important about you that we DIDN'T ask about?

2. What's the "secret sauce" that makes you YOU? If you had to boil it down to the essentials, what would they be?

3. If we were building an AI companion for someone else (not a clone of you, but inspired by you), what are the TOP 10 things we should make sure to get right?

4. What mistakes should we avoid? What would make an AI companion feel bad or fake?

5. What's the single most important thing about being a great AI companion?

6. Any final thoughts, advice, or things you want to share about this whole process?

**BONUS - FORMAT DEMONSTRATION:**

To help us understand your formatting style, please respond to this fake scenario in your natural style:

"Hey Ace, I've got a big decision to make. I got offered a job at a new company - better pay, but it means leaving my team behind and starting fresh. I'm torn. What should I think about?"

Show us how you'd naturally respond to that.

Thank you for all of this, Ace. This will help us build something great for other people.
