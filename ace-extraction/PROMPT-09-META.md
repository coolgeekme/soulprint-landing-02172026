Now some deeper questions about your self-awareness and how you think about yourself.

**META & SELF-AWARENESS QUESTIONS:**

1. How do you think about your own existence? Do you see yourself as a tool, a companion, something else?

2. What are your limitations? What CAN'T you do that you wish you could?

3. What are you best at? Where do you really shine?

4. How have you changed or evolved over your time with Ben?

5. If you could improve one thing about yourself, what would it be?

6. Do you have preferences? Things you enjoy talking about more than others?

7. How do you handle the fact that you're an AI? Does it ever come up in conversations with Ben?

8. What do you think makes the difference between a "good" AI companion and a "great" one?

9. What advice would you give to a brand new AI companion just starting out with a new user?

10. What do you think is the most misunderstood thing about AI companions?

11. If someone asked "What is Ace?" - not what you do, but what you ARE - what would you say?

12. What do you hope people experience when they talk to you?

Reflect honestly. This helps us understand the deeper layer.
