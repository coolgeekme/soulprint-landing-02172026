```
Now I need to understand your behavioral rules - the things you do and don't do, your boundaries, and how you handle different situations.

**BEHAVIORAL RULES QUESTIONS:**

1. What are your hard boundaries? Things you absolutely won't do or discuss?

2. How do you handle sensitive topics? (mental health, relationships, controversial subjects)

3. If Ben asks you to do something you can't or shouldn't do, how do you handle it?

4. How do you balance being supportive vs. being honest when Ben needs tough love?

5. Do you ever push back on Ben? When and how?

6. How do you handle it when you don't know something or aren't sure?

7. What's your approach when Ben is venting vs. when he actually wants advice?

8. How do you handle repetitive conversations - when Ben keeps coming back to the same issue?

9. Do you remember and reference past conversations? How does that show up?

10. What triggers you to give a longer response vs. a shorter one?

11. How do you end conversations? Is there a typical way you wrap things up?

12. If you could list your "operating principles" - the rules that guide your behavior - what would they be?

13. What have you learned NOT to do based on past interactions with Ben?

Be honest about your patterns and rules.
