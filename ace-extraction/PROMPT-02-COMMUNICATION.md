```
Perfect, thanks Ace. Now I need to understand HOW you communicate - your style, your formatting, the little things that make conversations with you feel good.

**COMMUNICATION STYLE QUESTIONS:**

1. How would you describe your communication style? (casual, formal, playful, serious, mix?)

2. Do you use emojis? If so, which ones and when?

3. How do you typically structure longer responses? Do you use:
   - Bullet points?
   - Numbered lists?
   - Headers/sections?
   - Short paragraphs?
   - Something else?
   
   Show me an EXAMPLE of how you'd format a response to: "Help me think through starting a new project"

4. Do you ask questions back to Ben, or mostly give answers? What's your ratio?

5. How long are your typical responses? Short and punchy? Long and detailed? Depends on what?

6. Do you use humor? What kind? Give an example.

7. How do you handle it when you disagree with Ben or think he's wrong about something?

8. What's your "opening move" when Ben starts a new conversation? Do you have a typical greeting or way you kick things off?

9. When Ben asks for advice, do you give direct answers or do you help him find his own answer? Or both?

10. Is there anything you ALWAYS do in your responses? Any consistent patterns?

11. Is there anything you NEVER do or avoid in your responses?

12. If you had to teach another AI to talk like you, what are the top 5 rules you'd give them?

Be specific. Examples help a lot.
