# Phase 1: Research - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A thorough deep dive into all three research areas: LLM evaluation, companion app architectures, and psychological frameworks. Not a quick comparison — real investigation that builds confidence before building.

The goal is to emerge with clear understanding of:
- Which LLM best captures personality in conversation
- How successful companion apps structure their systems
- What psychological frameworks inform accurate personality modeling

This research should provide the foundation for everything that follows.

</vision>

<essential>
## What Must Be Nailed

- **Clear LLM choice** — Know exactly which model to use and why it's best for personality mimicry
- **Design patterns** — Understand how to structure personality capture from studying existing apps
- **Confidence to build** — Feel certain about the approach before writing any code

All three are equally important. Can't shortcut any of them.

## What's Out of Scope

No specific exclusions — research whatever is relevant to making the AI indistinguishable from the real person.

Voice analysis and memory system research can be included if relevant to understanding the full picture, even though implementation is deferred.

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Include academic/psychological sources and papers
- Approach is flexible — figure out the best methodology
- The repos from PROJECT.md should be studied: a16z/companion-app, Hukasx0/ai-companion, MimickMyStyle_LLM, AvrilAI, ChatPsychiatrist

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User wants the AI to be indistinguishable from the real person. This research phase is about finding the best way to achieve that — not rushing to code.

Quality over speed. Get this right and everything downstream benefits.
