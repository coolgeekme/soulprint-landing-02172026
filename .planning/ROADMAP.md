## v2.2 Bulletproof Imports (ACTIVE)

**Milestone Goal:** Move all heavy import processing from Vercel to RLM (Render), port convoviz-quality parsing (DAG traversal, hidden message filtering, polymorphic parts), make imports work for any size export on any device.

**Overview:** This milestone eliminates the fundamental constraint causing import failures: Vercel serverless (1GB RAM, 300s timeout) cannot handle large ChatGPT exports. By moving all heavy processing to RLM on Render with streaming JSON parsing, we enable any size export (tested up to 2GB) on any device. Convoviz-quality parsing patterns ensure accurate conversation history (no dead branches from edits) and complete content handling (images, attachments). Real progress reporting and actionable error messages complete the bulletproof experience.

### Phase 1: Core Migration - RLM Pipeline with Streaming
**Goal:** All heavy import processing runs on RLM service (Render) with streaming JSON parser for constant-memory processing

**Depends on:** Nothing (first phase)

**Requirements:** IMP-01, IMP-02, IMP-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User uploads ChatGPT export (any size), Vercel authenticates and immediately returns 202 Accepted
2. RLM service downloads from Supabase Storage and processes export with constant memory usage (no OOM failures on 300MB+ files)
3. Import completes successfully for 300MB+ exports that previously failed on Vercel
4. Database shows progress updates (progress_percent) throughout RLM processing pipeline

**Plans:** 5 plans in 4 waves

Plans:
- [ ] 01-01-PLAN.md — Database schema + RLM streaming dependencies (Wave 1)
- [ ] 01-02-PLAN.md — Port quick pass logic to Python (Wave 1, parallel with 01-01)
- [ ] 01-03-PLAN.md — RLM streaming import endpoint (Wave 2)
- [ ] 01-04-PLAN.md — Vercel thin proxy integration (Wave 3)
- [ ] 01-05-PLAN.md — End-to-end verification (Wave 4, checkpoint)

### Phase 2: Parsing Quality - DAG Traversal and Content Handling
**Goal:** Conversation parsing uses DAG traversal for accurate history and handles all content types correctly

**Depends on:** Phase 1 (needs RLM pipeline established)

**Requirements:** PAR-01, PAR-02, PAR-03, PAR-04

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User's soulprint contains only actual conversation history (no duplicate or dead-branch messages from edits)
2. User's soulprint excludes hidden internal content (tool outputs, browsing traces, reasoning steps)
3. User's conversations with images or attachments are fully captured (all content.parts, not just parts[0])
4. Import works for both raw array and wrapped export formats ([...] and { conversations: [...] })

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

### Phase 3: UX Enhancement - Progress and Error Clarity
**Goal:** Users see real processing progress and receive actionable error messages when imports fail

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (needs complete pipeline for accurate progress tracking)

**Requirements:** UXP-01, UXP-02, UXP-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User sees specific processing stages ("Downloading export", "Parsing conversations", "Generating soulprint") instead of generic spinner
2. User receives specific error guidance when import fails (e.g., "File too large (2.3GB, max 2GB)" not "Something went wrong")
3. User successfully imports 100MB+ files from mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
4. User can close browser during import and return later to see completion (no page-open requirement)

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD during planning

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute sequentially: 1 → 2 → 3. Each phase builds on the previous infrastructure.

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Core Migration | 0/5 | Not started | - |
| 2. Parsing Quality | 0/TBD | Not started | - |
| 3. UX Enhancement | 0/TBD | Not started | - |
