## 🚧 v1.3 RLM Production Sync (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Sync v1.2 processor modules into production soulprint-rlm repo, fix incompatibilities, deploy full pass pipeline to Render.

This milestone merges v1.2's modular processor architecture into the production RLM service running on Render. The work follows a safe, incremental migration pattern: create adapter layer to break circular imports, copy processor modules with modified imports, wire new /process-full-v2 endpoint alongside existing v1 pipeline, implement full pass background processing, and gradually shift traffic from v1 to v2. Zero breaking changes to existing endpoints, instant rollback capability at every step.

### Phase 1: Dependency Extraction
**Goal**: Adapter layer exists and processors can import shared functions without circular dependencies
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: MERGE-02, MERGE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. adapters/supabase_adapter.py contains extracted functions (download_conversations, update_user_profile, save_chunks_batch)
  2. Production schema verified — chunk_tier enum values documented
  3. Adapter functions have unit tests with 100% coverage
  4. No production code modified (main.py unchanged, zero risk)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — TDD: Supabase adapter layer with 100% test coverage

### Phase 2: Copy & Modify Processors
**Goal**: v1.2 processor modules are integrated and Dockerfile can build container with all modules verified
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: MERGE-01, MERGE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. processors/ directory contains 5 modules from v1.2 with imports modified to use adapter
  2. Dockerfile builds successfully and imports all processor modules at build time
  3. Processor unit tests pass in isolation with mocked adapter
  4. pytest and pytest-asyncio installed and working
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Copy 5 processor modules to production, modify full_pass.py imports, update Dockerfile
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Write processor unit tests and update pytest coverage config

### Phase 3: Wire New Endpoint
**Goal**: /process-full-v2 endpoint exists alongside /process-full v1 with parallel deployment capability
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: PIPE-01, DEPLOY-01, DEPLOY-02, DEPLOY-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. /process-full-v2 endpoint accepts requests and dispatches background task
  2. Health check validates all processor modules import correctly at startup
  3. All 14 existing production endpoints continue working (backwards compatibility verified)
  4. Rollback procedure documented with concrete git revert commands
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Migrate to lifespan, add /process-full-v2 endpoint, enhance /health
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Backwards compatibility tests and rollback documentation

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration
**Goal**: Full pass pipeline completes end-to-end with monitoring and handles large exports gracefully
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: PIPE-02, PIPE-03, PIPE-04, MON-01, MON-02, MON-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pipeline executes all 9 steps: chunk → extract facts (parallel) → consolidate → generate MEMORY → regenerate v2 sections → save to DB
  2. Large exports (5000+ conversations) complete without OOM via hierarchical fact reduction
  3. Pipeline failure is non-fatal — users can chat with v1 sections if v2 processing fails
  4. full_pass_status field tracks pipeline state (processing/complete/failed)
  5. FACT_EXTRACTION_CONCURRENCY configurable via environment variable (default 3 for Render Starter tier)
  6. Pipeline errors logged with context (user_id, step, error) for debugging
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01-PLAN.md — Pipeline hardening: configurable concurrency, status tracking, enhanced error logging
- [ ] 04-02-PLAN.md — Integration tests for pipeline + SQL migration for full_pass_status columns

### Phase 5: Gradual Cutover
**Goal**: v2 pipeline handles 100% of production traffic and v1 endpoint is deprecated
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: CUT-01, CUT-02, CUT-03, DEPLOY-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Traffic routes to v1 or v2 pipeline based on configuration (10% → 50% → 100% cutover)
  2. v2 pipeline validated with real user data on production before full cutover
  3. v1 /process-full endpoint deprecated after v2 handles 100% traffic for 7+ days
  4. Production RLM deployed to Render with v1.2 capabilities via git push
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] TBD
