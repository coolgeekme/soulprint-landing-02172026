# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** The import-to-chat flow must work reliably every time on production
**Current focus:** Phase 5 complete — next: Phase 6 - Comprehensive Testing

## Current Position

Phase: 6 of 7 (Comprehensive Testing)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 06-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [█████████░] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 3m 39s
- Total execution time: 1.09 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-testing-foundation | 2 | 3m 16s | 1m 38s |
| 02-memory-resource-cleanup | 3 | 14m 46s | 4m 55s |
| 03-race-condition-fixes | 3 | 5m 59s | 2m 0s |
| 04-security-hardening | 6 | 25m 41s | 4m 17s |
| 05-observability | 2 | 8m 58s | 4m 29s |
| 06-comprehensive-testing | 2 | 13m 4s | 6m 32s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-06 (6m 34s), 05-01 (6m 18s), 05-02 (2m 40s), 06-01 (5m 14s), 06-02 (7m 50s)
- Trend: Integration tests for complex flows (import pipeline) take longer than simple route tests

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stabilization approach: Fix everything from audit before adding new features
- Testing strategy: User validates on deployed Vercel production (not localhost)
- Scope: Exclude voice/pillar features to focus purely on bug fixes and hardening
- Use Vitest over Jest for modern, faster test runner with better Vite integration (01-01)
- Use MSW for API mocking via Service Worker approach for realistic testing (01-01)
- Co-locate tests next to source files for maintainability (01-02)
- Use @/* path aliases in tests to verify alias resolution works (01-02)
- .unref() on setInterval timers prevents blocking serverless process exit (02-01)
- Dual cleanup strategy: lazy deletion on access + proactive background cleanup (02-01)
- 30-minute TTL for abandoned uploads based on typical upload duration (02-01)
- 15s RLM timeout balances responsiveness vs. cold-start accommodation (02-02)
- AbortSignal.timeout() replaces manual AbortController for cleaner code (02-02)
- TimeoutError handling enables circuit breaker to distinguish timeout from other failures (02-02)
- Centralized error handling prevents information disclosure (02-03)
- Descriptive context strings in handleAPIError enable precise error tracking (02-03)
- 15-minute threshold distinguishes fresh vs stuck imports for duplicate detection (03-01)
- HTTP 409 Conflict for business-logic duplicate rejection (03-01)
- Query-before-upsert pattern for duplicate detection with time-based threshold (03-01)
- AbortSignal.any for composing caller + timeout signals with feature detection fallback (03-02)
- Sequence tracking via local closure counter + shared useRef for stale poll detection (03-03)
- AbortController cleanup on all chat page useEffects to prevent unmounted state updates (03-03)
- auth.uid() for RLS policies over auth.jwt()->>'user_metadata' for cryptographic verification (04-03)
- Idempotent SQL via IF NOT EXISTS checks for safe re-runs during deployment (04-03)
- Service role key bypasses RLS for trusted server-side operations (04-03)
- 3 tiered rate limits: standard (60/min), expensive (20/min), upload (100/min) for different endpoint costs (04-02)
- Fail-open rate limiting: if Redis down, allow requests through for availability (04-02)
- Lazy Redis initialization prevents build failures when Upstash env vars missing (04-02)
- Per-user rate limiting (not IP-based) for authenticated abuse prevention (04-02)
- Use @edge-csrf/nextjs despite deprecation - no alternative exists for edge runtime (04-01)
- CSRF before auth in middleware chain for early rejection of invalid requests (04-01)
- 'unsafe-inline' CSP directives acceptable for Next.js/Tailwind compatibility (04-01)
- Zod safeParse over parse for no-throw validation with explicit error handling (04-04)
- Schema-based error messages hide internal structure to prevent schema disclosure attacks (04-04)
- Centralized schemas in lib/api/schemas.ts for single source of truth and reuse (04-04)
- Cache CSRF token in module-level variable to avoid repeated network requests (04-05)
- Get CSRF token once per function for multiple fetch calls to optimize performance (04-05)
- Use getCsrfToken directly over csrfFetch wrapper for minimal disruption to existing patterns (04-05)
- Use Pino over Winston for performance and modern JSON logging (05-01)
- Generate correlation IDs in Edge-compatible middleware using crypto.randomUUID() (05-01)
- Don't import Pino in middleware (Edge runtime incompatible) - only set headers (05-01)
- Replace console.error in error handler but keep selective console.log for hot path only (05-01)
- Support LOG_LEVEL env var override for production debugging (05-01)
- Use server.use() for per-test MSW overrides, keep default handlers minimal (06-01)
- Mock @/lib/supabase/server at module level for per-test auth control (06-01)
- Check Prefer header to return single object vs array for .single() queries (06-01)
- Mock Blob.arrayBuffer() for Node.js compatibility (native Blob lacks this method) (06-02)
- Use vi.mocked() helper to access mock function calls instead of storing references (06-02)
- Test Zod validation with code check instead of exact message (messages vary) (06-02)
