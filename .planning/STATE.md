## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v2.2: Move heavy processing from Vercel to RLM (Render) — Vercel is the bottleneck (1GB RAM, 300s timeout)
- v2.2: Use ijson streaming JSON parser for constant-memory processing of any size export (tested up to 2GB)
- v2.2: Port convoviz-quality parsing — DAG traversal, hidden message filtering, polymorphic content.parts
- v2.2: Vercel becomes thin proxy (auth + trigger), RLM does all heavy lifting
- 01-01: Track progress with progress_percent (0-100) and import_stage (text) for real-time UI updates
- 01-01: Upgrade anthropic to anthropic[bedrock] for AWS Bedrock Claude support

### Pending Todos

- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known gaps addressed in v2.2:**
- Import parsing only takes `parts[0]` — misses multi-part content (PAR-03)
- Import dumps ALL conversation nodes — includes dead branches from edits (PAR-01)
- Import doesn't filter hidden messages — tool outputs, browsing noise (PAR-02)
- Import doesn't handle `{ conversations: [...] }` wrapper format (PAR-04)
- Large exports OOM on Vercel — 1GB RAM limit, 300s timeout (IMP-01, IMP-02)

**New concerns for v2.2:**
- Render cold start delays (up to 60s) require explicit UX handling
- ChatGPT export format variations (no official spec) need defensive parsing
- Mobile large file testing needed for 100MB+ files on iOS/Android
