# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-06)

**Core value:** The import-to-chat flow must work reliably every time on production
**Current focus:** Phase 4 - Security Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (Security Hardening)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 04-03-PLAN.md (RLS audit and remediation scripts)

Progress: [█████████░] 90%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: 2m 32s
- Total execution time: 0.40 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-testing-foundation | 2 | 3m 16s | 1m 38s |
| 02-memory-resource-cleanup | 3 | 14m 46s | 4m 55s |
| 03-race-condition-fixes | 3 | 5m 59s | 2m 0s |
| 04-security-hardening | 1 | 1m 4s | 1m 4s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-03 (8m 8s), 03-01 (2m 0s), 03-02 (1m 59s), 03-03 (2m 0s), 04-03 (1m 4s)
- Trend: Simple script creation and SQL work very fast (~1 minute)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stabilization approach: Fix everything from audit before adding new features
- Testing strategy: User validates on deployed Vercel production (not localhost)
- Scope: Exclude voice/pillar features to focus purely on bug fixes and hardening
- Use Vitest over Jest for modern, faster test runner with better Vite integration (01-01)
- Use MSW for API mocking via Service Worker approach for realistic testing (01-01)
- Co-locate tests next to source files for maintainability (01-02)
- Use @/* path aliases in tests to verify alias resolution works (01-02)
- .unref() on setInterval timers prevents blocking serverless process exit (02-01)
- Dual cleanup strategy: lazy deletion on access + proactive background cleanup (02-01)
- 30-minute TTL for abandoned uploads based on typical upload duration (02-01)
- 15s RLM timeout balances responsiveness vs. cold-start accommodation (02-02)
- AbortSignal.timeout() replaces manual AbortController for cleaner code (02-02)
- TimeoutError handling enables circuit breaker to distinguish timeout from other failures (02-02)
- Centralized error handling prevents information disclosure (02-03)
- Descriptive context strings in handleAPIError enable precise error tracking (02-03)
- 15-minute threshold distinguishes fresh vs stuck imports for duplicate detection (03-01)
- HTTP 409 Conflict for business-logic duplicate rejection (03-01)
- Query-before-upsert pattern for duplicate detection with time-based threshold (03-01)
- AbortSignal.any for composing caller + timeout signals with feature detection fallback (03-02)
- Sequence tracking via local closure counter + shared useRef for stale poll detection (03-03)
- AbortController cleanup on all chat page useEffects to prevent unmounted state updates (03-03)
- auth.uid() for RLS policies over auth.jwt()->>'user_metadata' for cryptographic verification (04-03)
- Idempotent SQL via IF NOT EXISTS checks for safe re-runs during deployment (04-03)
- Service role key bypasses RLS for trusted server-side operations (04-03)
