## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v2.4 (01-02): Use lastKnownPercentRef for monotonic guard across polling and handleFile flows
- v2.4 (01-02): Keep RingProgress file but remove drop-shadow (may be used elsewhere)
- v2.4 (01-02): Wrap AnimatedProgressStages in motion.div for AnimatePresence compatibility
- v2.4 (01-01): Pure function progress mapper with monotonic guard enforces stability client-side
- v2.4 (01-01): 4-stage model (Upload 0-49%, Extract 50-59%, Analyze 60-79%, Build 80-100%) maps to actual pipeline phases
- v2.4 (01-01): Framer Motion 300ms transitions for stage changes, pulsing active stage animation
- v2.4 (01-01): No SVG drop-shadow filters — GPU-composited animations only (opacity + transform) for mobile performance
- v2.4: Use Framer Motion 12.29.2 (already installed) for stage animations — no new dependencies
- v2.4: Stage-based progress with 4 stages (Upload → Extract → Analyze → Build Profile) mapped to backend milestones
- v2.4: Smooth fade transition via template.tsx pattern (App Router compatible, not AnimatePresence)
- v2.4: Frontend-only refactoring — no backend changes, existing 3s polling stays
- v2.4: Monotonic progress (never goes backwards) enforced client-side
- Research: Perceived progress matters more than accuracy per UX research (NN/G, UXPin)
- Import flow: Files >100MB skip JSZip, upload raw ZIP for server-side extraction
- RLM: Full pass runs in background (chunks → facts → memory → v2 sections)
- RLM: Streaming import sends SSE events for progress tracking

### Pending Todos

- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)
- Full pass chunk saves now working (token_count column fix deployed)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Active:**
- Full pass killed by Render redeploys (every push to rlm-service/ triggers restart)
- Fact extraction costs ~$8-10 per import (2140 Haiku API calls)
- Two users (79898043, 39cce7a5) have pending full passes

**None blocking v2.4 work** — This milestone is frontend-only refactoring.

## Session Continuity

Resume file: None
Next step: Phase 2 - Smooth Transitions (template.tsx page transition pattern)

*Last updated: 2026-02-11 -- Completed Phase 1: Stage-based animated progress fully integrated into import page with monotonic enforcement and mobile-safe rendering. Ready for Phase 2 (smooth page transitions).*
