## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- v2.0: Haiku 4.5 for emotion detection (fast, cheap, fail-safe defaults)
- v2.0: Three separate quality judges (specialized per dimension)
- v2.0: Fire-and-forget quality scoring (non-blocking)
- v2.1 Phase 1 Plan 1: Pass EI parameters as-is from TypeScript to Python without transformation
- v2.1 Phase 1 Plan 1: Use build_emotionally_intelligent_prompt in both RLM and fallback paths for consistent EI behavior
- v2.1 Phase 2 Plan 1: Use 'as const' assertions for union type literals instead of type annotations
- v2.1 Phase 2 Plan 1: Use 'as any' for Vitest mock overrides (pragmatic test-only approach)
- v2.1 Phase 2 Plan 1: Import actual types instead of inline test definitions (single source of truth)
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 1: Use HEAD requests only for citation validation (fast, no body download)
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 1: Validate before LLM prompt to prevent hallucinated citations
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 1: Accept 2xx and 3xx status codes (legitimate redirects)
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 1: Block localhost and private IPs for SSRF protection
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 2: Send citations as separate SSE event (type='citations') after content streaming
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 2: Display citations in message footer, not inline with content
- v2.1 Phase 3 Plan 2: Show clean domain names (e.g., 'nytimes.com') not full URLs

### Pending Todos

- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)
- DB migrations executed (confirmed 2026-02-09)

### Blockers/Concerns

Known gaps addressed by v2.1:
- ~~RLM service does NOT use EI parameters (only Bedrock fallback gets EI) → Phase 1~~ ✅ RESOLVED (01-01)
- ~~10 test mock type errors + 7 cross-language type errors → Phase 2~~ ✅ RESOLVED (02-01)
- ~~Web search citations not validated against hallucination → Phase 3~~ ✅ RESOLVED (03-01 backend validation, 03-02 frontend display)
