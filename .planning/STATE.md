## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.2: Replace monolithic soulprint_text with 7 structured sections (SOUL, IDENTITY, USER, AGENTS, TOOLS, MEMORY, daily memory)
- v1.2: Two-pass pipeline -- quick pass (~30s, Haiku 4.5) for 5 sections, full pass (RLM background) for MEMORY + v2 regen
- v1.2: Gate chat on quick pass completion only, let MEMORY build in background
- v1.2: Remove "SoulPrint is ready" email (users are already chatting by then)
- 01-01: Use z.preprocess for permissive Zod 4 object defaults
- 01-01: Promoted ParsedConversation/ConversationMessage to shared exports in lib/soulprint/types.ts
- 01-02: Store sections as JSON.stringify'd strings in TEXT *_md columns
- 01-02: Quick pass runs synchronously between conversation parsing and RLM fire-and-forget
- 01-02: Replaced local type duplicates in process-server with shared imports
- 02-01: Use FastAPI BackgroundTasks for async dispatch (cleaner than asyncio.create_task)
- 02-01: Status updates to Supabase are best-effort (log errors, don't throw)
- 02-01: Stub marks status as 'complete' after 1s sleep (Plan 02-02 will add real processing)

### Pending Todos

- Run `supabase/migrations/20260206_add_tools_md.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- Run `supabase/migrations/20260207_full_pass_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (MUST execute before deploying Plans 02-02/02-03)
- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)
- Verify CSRF middleware rejects unauthenticated POSTs on production
