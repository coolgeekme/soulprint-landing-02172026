## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Carried from v1.3:**
- Separate soulprint-rlm repo — Production RLM deploys from Pu11en/soulprint-rlm
- RLM prompt should use OpenClaw-inspired approach: "You're not a chatbot. You're becoming someone."
- Focus on RLM primary path, not Bedrock fallback

**New for v1.4:**
- 2-phase structure: Phase 6 (build prompt foundation) + Phase 7 (deploy to production)
- Incorporate existing prototype code from app/api/chat/route.ts and rlm-service/main.py
- DB migrations already written, just need execution
- Case-insensitive regex for "not enough data" matching (06-01)
- Sorted keys in formatSection for deterministic output (06-01)
- Defensive filtering: formatSection filters placeholders even if cleanSection wasn't called (06-01)

### Pending Todos

- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)
- Run pending DB migrations: `20260201_soulprint_files.sql`, `20260206_add_tools_md.sql`, `20260207_full_pass_schema.sql`
- v1.3 Phase 5 human-timeline cutover still in progress (V2_ROLLOUT_PERCENT 0% → 100% over 3-4 weeks)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Uncommitted code changes exist in rlm-service/main.py and app/api/chat/route.ts from earlier prototyping — need to be incorporated into Phase 6 plans (not thrown away)
- Research indicates context window bloat risk — deferred for v1.4, will measure usage in production before optimizing
