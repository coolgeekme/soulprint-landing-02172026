# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Your AI should know you — import once, never repeat yourself.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Production Hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Production Hardening)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: **Debugging import freeze**
Last activity: 2026-02-05 09:07 — XHR upload implementation

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40%

### Active Debug
**Issue:** Import freezes at 50%  
**Doc:** `.planning/debug/import-freeze-2026-02-05.md`  
**Status:** XHR upload deployed, awaiting test

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4 (Phase 1)
- Average duration: ~45 min
- Total execution time: ~3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Core MVP | 4/4 | 3h | 45min |
| 2. Hardening | 0/3 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 30m, 45m, 60m, 45m
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Recent decisions affecting current work:
- Phase 1: Client-side parsing for large files (10GB+)
- Phase 1: Multi-tier chunking (100/500/2000 chars)
- Phase 2: Added logging to silent catch blocks

Full log: PROJECT.md Key Decisions

### Pending Todos

- [x] Test with Drew's 1.8GB ChatGPT export ✅ (fixed import freeze)
- [x] Add upload progress indicator ✅ (XHR real progress)
- [ ] Improve error toasts for user feedback
- [ ] Add network timeout handling to /api/chat

### Open Specs (need Drew input)

- [ ] **SOULPRINT-INSTRUCTIONS** — Base AI personality/behavior (`.planning/specs/SOULPRINT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
  - Waiting on answers to 6 questions

- [ ] **MOBILE-UX-REDESIGN** — Fix bad mobile UX + UI (`.planning/specs/MOBILE-UX-REDESIGN.md`)
  - Need Drew to identify worst screens
  - Check if Figma designs exist to match

### Blockers/Concerns

- RLM cold start on Render can be slow (~10s after idle)
- Large imports may timeout on slower connections
