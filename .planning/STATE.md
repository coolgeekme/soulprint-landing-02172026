## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Carried forward:**
- Separate soulprint-rlm repo -- Production RLM deploys from Pu11en/soulprint-rlm
- Sonnet 4.5 on Bedrock for chat quality (switched from Nova Lite)
- OpenClaw-style prompt: minimal preamble, sections define personality
- Focus on RLM primary path, not Bedrock fallback
- ESM imports for react-syntax-highlighter (not CJS - TypeScript compatibility)
- User messages as plain text, AI messages as markdown (ChatGPT/Claude pattern)
- next-themes for dark mode with system preference detection
- Tailwind CSS variable system for theme-aware UI (bg-background, text-foreground, etc.)
- Mounted guard pattern for theme toggle to prevent hydration mismatch
- RLM responses chunked in ~20-char increments with 10ms delay for progressive rendering
- Bedrock uses ConverseStreamCommand for true token-by-token streaming
- ReadableStream pattern: return Response immediately, async work in start() callback
- maxDuration=60 for Vercel function timeout on long-running streams
- AbortController pattern for fetch cancellation: create before fetch, store in ref, abort on stop
- isGenerating state separate from isLoading to distinguish streaming vs pre-streaming phases
- Stop button (red square icon) replaces send/mic during generation with graceful abort
- Haiku 3.5 for title generation (fast/cheap for 3-8 word summaries)
- conversation_id required in saveMessageSchema (every message belongs to conversation)
- Conversation.updated_at refreshed on message save for sidebar recency sorting

### Pending Todos

- Run `scripts/rls-audit.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (from v1.1 Phase 4)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Web search (smartSearch) exists but citations not validated against hallucination
