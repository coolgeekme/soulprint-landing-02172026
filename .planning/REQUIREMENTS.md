# Requirements: SoulPrint v1.5 Full Chat Experience

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** The AI must feel like YOUR AI -- personalized chat with full-featured UX.

## v1.5 Requirements

Requirements for the Full Chat Experience milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Conversation Management

- [ ] **CONV-01**: User can see a sidebar listing all their conversations
- [ ] **CONV-02**: User can create a new conversation
- [ ] **CONV-03**: User can switch between conversations (messages load for selected conversation)
- [ ] **CONV-04**: User can delete a conversation
- [ ] **CONV-05**: User can rename a conversation
- [ ] **CONV-06**: Conversations auto-generate a title from the first exchange
- [ ] **CONV-07**: Existing chat messages are migrated into a default conversation without data loss

### Streaming

- [ ] **STRM-01**: User sees AI responses render token-by-token in real time
- [ ] **STRM-02**: User can stop/cancel AI response generation mid-stream
- [ ] **STRM-03**: Streaming works through Vercel serverless (no buffering, correct runtime config)

### Rich Rendering

- [x] **RNDR-01**: AI responses render markdown (headers, lists, bold, italic, links, tables)
- [x] **RNDR-02**: Code blocks render with syntax highlighting
- [x] **RNDR-03**: Code blocks have a one-click copy button
- [x] **RNDR-04**: Markdown rendering is XSS-safe (rehype-sanitize, no javascript: links)

### Web Search

- [ ] **SRCH-01**: User can trigger web search / research mode for current-info queries
- [ ] **SRCH-02**: AI responses include inline source citations with clickable links
- [ ] **SRCH-03**: Citation URLs are validated against actual search results (no hallucinated links)

### Dark Mode

- [x] **DARK-01**: User can toggle between dark and light themes
- [x] **DARK-02**: Theme respects system preference on first visit
- [x] **DARK-03**: All UI components render correctly in both themes (no invisible text, broken contrast)

### Voice Input

- **CONV-09**: Cross-conversation memory highlights (surface relevant past conversations)

### Voice

- **VOIC-04**: Voice output / text-to-speech for AI responses
- **VOIC-05**: Offline voice recognition (privacy mode)

### Rendering

- **RNDR-05**: Rich media rendering (images, videos in responses)
- **RNDR-06**: Memory evolution timeline visualization

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Model picker | User explicitly excluded -- single model (Sonnet 4.5) |
| Artifact/canvas panel | User explicitly excluded -- defer to v2+ |
| Real-time collaboration | Massive complexity, unclear value for personal AI |
| Unlimited conversation branching | Confusing UI, ChatGPT doesn't do this |
| Manual memory editing | Cognitive burden, users won't maintain |
| Over-engineered persona switching | Dilutes core SoulPrint value |
