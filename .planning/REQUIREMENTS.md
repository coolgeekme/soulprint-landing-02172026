# Requirements: SoulPrint v2.1 Hardening & Integration

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** The AI must feel like YOUR AI -- genuinely human, deeply personalized, systematically evaluated.

## v2.1 Requirements

Requirements for the Hardening & Integration milestone. Closes known gaps from v2.0.

### RLM Emotional Intelligence

- [x] **RLEI-01**: RLM service receives emotional_state parameter from TypeScript chat route
- [x] **RLEI-02**: RLM service receives relationship_arc parameter from TypeScript chat route
- [x] **RLEI-03**: Python PromptBuilder uses emotional_state and relationship_arc when building RLM prompts
- [x] **RLEI-04**: Both RLM and Bedrock fallback paths produce emotionally intelligent responses

### Test Quality

- [x] **TEST-01**: Cross-language sync tests compile without type errors (EmotionalState, PromptBuilderProfile)
- [x] **TEST-02**: Integration test mocks (complete.test.ts, process-server.test.ts) compile without type errors
- [x] **TEST-03**: All test files pass TypeScript strict mode checks (zero errors in `npx tsc --noEmit`)

### Web Search Validation

- [x] **WSRV-01**: Web search citations are validated against source content before surfacing to user
- [x] **WSRV-02**: Hallucinated or unreachable citations are filtered out or flagged
- [x] **WSRV-03**: User sees citation source indicators (domain name) alongside search-informed responses

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Linguistic mirroring | Feature work, not tech debt — future milestone |
| Memory narrative improvements | Feature work — future milestone |
| RLS audit execution | Manual task, not code work |
| Chat pagination | Optimization, not in this cleanup scope |
| Test coverage expansion | Only fixing existing broken tests, not writing new ones |
